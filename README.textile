h1. What is this?

This is an example Rails 3 application to login to Github using OAuth2 and Devise

For more details on Githubs OAuth2 Setup - http://gist.github.com/419219

h2. Instructions

* Clone me <code>git clone git://github.com/lloydpick/rail3_github_oauth2_devise_example.git</code>
* Go go magic bundler <code>bundle install</code>

Register for an application - http://github.com/account/applications/new - and fill in the form...

  Name:  My Super Cool App (Development)
  Main URL:  http://localhost:8080
  Callback URL:  http://localhost:8080/users/oauth2

Put the Client ID and Secret codes into the <code>config/oauth2_config.yml</code> file. By default this will have the
<code>authorize_path</code> and <code>access_token_path</code> setup correctly for Github Auth.

Then just boot up the app with the server of your choice and click the "Sign in with Github" link. It should
take you off to Github, ask you to authorize, then back to your app, creating a devise user, and logging you in.
